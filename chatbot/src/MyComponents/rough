  <p>
   I love chatting with machines, and for the past five years, I've been diving deep into machine learning. I'm lucky enough to make a living doing what I adore—talking to these incredible machines using Python, which is like a second language to me.</p>

<p>My typical day involves lots of cool stuff! I research, design, run experiments, evaluate results, and do a ton of coding. But when I'm not glued to tech, I'm all about the butterfly effect—I believe small actions can lead to big impacts. I enjoy reading, exploring various topics, and playing cricket or football for fun and a good break.</p>

<p>In a nutshell, I'm all about the magic of tech and creativity coming together. I'm endlessly curious and always up for new challenges in the world of data science and machine learning. Can't wait to explore more!
